h2. Current State and Gotchas

Right now it's very basic. This is just the beginning. This is by no means a complete project yet. I just got tired of waiting. The things todo class does not allow you to set the ID of the todo, so to ensure no duplicates are created the applescript uses a tag on the todo element based on the ID from redmine.
